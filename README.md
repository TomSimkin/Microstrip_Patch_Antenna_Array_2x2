The specifications of the antenna array are as follows: 
• 4 elements that are in a 2x2 order.
 
• Each element is connected by an individual vertical SMA connector. 

• Distance between each element is 12.5mm. 

• The elements lie on 2 substrates: FR4 and Rogers 4350. 

The former substrate will be positioned between the ground and Rogers 4350; 
each substrate is 0.8mm thick. 

The substrate dimensions are 50x50 mm.
